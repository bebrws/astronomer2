# Exercise 0: Astro and Astro IDE

## Set Up Astro IDE

This workshop does not require any local Airflow installation. Instead, all development takes place within Astro and the Astro IDE. The first step is to set up a **free** Astro trial to run Airflow and access the Astro IDE for Dag development.

While a deep understanding of the Astro platform is not required, here is a quick overview: Each customer has a dedicated Organization on Astro. An Organization can contain multiple Workspaces (for example, one per team). Each Workspace can have multiple Deployments, where a Deployment is a fully hosted Airflow environment.

1. Use the link provided by your workshop host to create a free trial of Astro, alternatively use [this link](https://www.astronomer.io/lp/signup/?utm_source=conference&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=devrel-workshop).

    - After creating an account, verifying your email, and logging in, choose _Personal_ in the first step.
    - Next, choose an _Organization_ and _Workspace_ name. These can be fictional names and you can change them later.
    - In the third step, click the small link at the bottom under the two boxes: _Or skip this and go to your workspace_.

    ![Create an empty environment](doc/screenshot-trial-setup.png)

    - You should now see the Astro platform UI.

2. Open the _Astro IDE_ from the left navigation and select _Connect Git project..._
3. Under _Select a Git provider for manual configuration_, select _GitHub_ and enter the following details:

    - **ACCOUNT**: `astronomer`
    - **REPOSITORY**: `devrel-public-workshops`
    - _Keep Astro Project Path empty_
    - **BRANCH**: `workshops/astrotrips/etl`
    - **AUTHENTICATION TYPE**: `None (public repository)`
    - Click _Connect_. The IDE will import and open the project for you.

    ![Connect Git project in Astro IDE](doc/screenshot-select-git-repo.png)

**You now have the Astro IDE with the project ready to go.**

![Astro IDE](doc/screenshot-astro-ide.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You don't need to commit your changes. If you want to keep your code after the workshop, fork the repository first.

> [!TIP]
> The Astro IDE comes with an integrated AI assistant, optimized for workflow orchestration with Apache Airflow. Feel free to interact with it during this workshop to learn more about certain concepts.

## Set Up the Connection

This workshop relies on a DuckDB database. To ensure your test environments can connect to it, the next step is to create a workspace-wide connection.

> [!NOTE]
> The next two steps take place in the main Astro platform UI, not inside the Astro IDE. If you collapsed the sidebar, expand it to navigate.

![Navigate to Connections](doc/screenshot-navigate-connections.png)

1. In Astro, navigate to _Environment_ → _Connections_ and click the _+ Connection_ button.
2. In the dialog, search for and select _Generic_, then enter the following details:

    ![Select generic type](doc/screenshot-add-connection-generic.png)

    - **CONNECTION ID**: `duckdb_astrotrips`
    - **TYPE**: `duckdb`
    - **HOST**: `include/astrotrips.duckdb`
    - Set **AUTOMATICALLY LINK TO ALL DEPLOYMENTS** to _On_

    ![Add connection](doc/screenshot-add-connection.png)

3. Click _Create Connection_.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about [Airflow connections](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/connections).

## Start the test deployment and run the setup Dag

The final setup step is to start a test deployment (a fully functional Airflow environment) and run the `setup` Dag, which creates the DuckDB database with tables and sample data for the following exercises.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not close the Astro IDE browser tab during the workshop. Always use this tab to return to the Astro IDE instead of reopening it to preserve your session. If you close it, you will need to create a new test deployment.

1. Navigate to the _Astro IDE_ and click _Start Test Deployment_ in the top right corner. The deployment takes 3-5 minutes to spin up.
2. While the deployment is starting, click the dropdown next to _Sync to Test_ and select _Test Deployment Details_.

    ![Open test deployment details](doc/screenshot-open-deployment-details.png)

3. Navigate to the _Environment_ tab and click _Edit Deployment Variables_.
4. In the popup, remove the `AIRFLOW__SCHEDULER__USE_JOB_SCHEDULE` variable to enable scheduling for the test deployment.
5. Click _Update Environment Variables_.

    ![Change environment variables](doc/screenshot-env-vars.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Scheduling is disabled by default for test deployments to prevent Dags from running automatically. This gives you maximum control during development and helps avoid unwanted side effects. However, for this workshop, we want Dags to be scheduled based on asset updates, so we enable scheduling accordingly.

6. Back in the Astro IDE, once the test deployment is ready, select _Open Airflow_, from the same dropdown menu.

    ![Open Airflow](doc/screenshot-open-airflow.png)

7. In the Airflow UI, open the Dags view from the left menu and trigger the `setup` Dag using the play button.

    ![Trigger setup Dag](doc/screenshot-trigger-setup-dag.png)

**Once the Dag run completes successfully, your database is ready.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Running this Dag resets and re-creates the database. If you encounter any issues in the following exercises, simply run this Dag again.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **AstroTrips Dashboard**
>
> This workshop includes a prebuilt **AstroTrips Dashboard** to visualize the data. You can find it in the left navigation of the Airflow UI under **AstroTrips Dashboard**. It provides a visual overview of the data, including revenue by planet, trends over time, and current weather conditions for each destination. We will populate it with data during the workshop.
>
> Later in this workshops, you can run the `sync` Dag manually to update the dashboard. The `sync` Dag reads the latest report and weather data and makes it available to the dashboard. It is pre-provided in `dags/sync.py`, **please do not edit or delete it**.

---

# Exercise 1: Build the daily report Dag

In this exercise, you will create a Dag that ingests new booking data, generates a daily report, and validates the output. Successful validation updates an Airflow **asset**, signaling to downstream Dags that fresh data is available.

**What you will learn:**

- Running parameterized SQL queries with `SQLExecuteQueryOperator`.
- Validating data with `SQLColumnCheckOperator`.
- Publishing an asset to signal data availability.

## Create the Dag file

1. In the Astro IDE, create a new file `dags/daily_report.py` (right-click on the `dags` folder and select _New file..._).
2. Add the following imports and connection constant:

    ```python
    from airflow.configuration import AIRFLOW_HOME
    from airflow.providers.common.sql.operators.sql import SQLExecuteQueryOperator, SQLColumnCheckOperator
    from airflow.sdk import dag, chain, Asset
    from pendulum import datetime

    _DUCKDB_CONN_ID = "duckdb_astrotrips"
    ```

3. Define the Dag using the `@dag` decorator:

    ```python
    @dag(
        schedule="@daily",
        start_date=datetime(2026, 1, 1),
        tags=["astrotrips", "reporting"],
        template_searchpath=f"{AIRFLOW_HOME}/include/sql"
    )
    def daily_report():
        pass

    daily_report()
    ```

    The `template_searchpath` parameter tells Airflow where to find SQL files referenced by name.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about [Airflow decorators and the TaskFlow API](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/airflow-decorators).

> [!NOTE]
> The `pass` statement is a placeholder. When you add your first task inside the function, remove the `pass` statement.

## Add the ingest task

The first task simulates ingesting new booking data by calling a SQL script that generates random bookings.

1. Inside the `daily_report()` function, add:

    ```python
    _ingest_data = SQLExecuteQueryOperator(
        task_id="ingest",
        conn_id=_DUCKDB_CONN_ID,
        sql="generate.sql",
        params={ "n_bookings": 5 }
    )
    ```

    The `params` dictionary passes variables to the SQL template. Open `include/sql/generate.sql` to see how `{{ params.n_bookings }}` is used.

> [!NOTE]
> **`parameters` vs `params`**
>
> These two attributes serve different purposes:
>
> - **`parameters`** uses database-level parameter binding. The placeholder syntax depends on your database driver (e.g., `$reportDate` for DuckDB, `%(name)s` for Postgres). This is the preferred and secure approach since the database driver handles escaping, preventing SQL injection. You can still use Jinja templating for the values themselves, when instantiating the operator.
>
> - **`params`** uses Jinja templating before the query reaches the database driver. It treats your SQL as a plain string and replaces `{{ params.name }}` placeholders. This is useful when the SQL structure itself needs to be dynamic, like repeating query fragments multiple times.
>
> Learn more about parameters vs params [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNAzQgvcQGM). It also demonstrates the risk of SQL injection.

> [!NOTE]
> **How `SQLExecuteQueryOperator` works under the hood**
>
> The `SQLExecuteQueryOperator` is a generic operator for running SQL workloads from Airflow. It relies on the [`DbApiHook`](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-common-sql/stable/_api/airflow/providers/common/sql/hooks/sql/index.html) abstract base class, which is designed to work with Python's [DB-API 2.0 (PEP 249)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/) specification, the standard interface for database access in Python.
>
> Each database provider (Postgres, Snowflake, DuckDB, etc.) ships its own hook that inherits from `DbApiHook` and wraps the native database driver. As long as the provider package is installed and implements a proper `DbApiHook` subclass, you can use this operator with any compliant database.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about [executing SQL with Airflow](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/airflow-sql).

## Add the report generation task

The second task aggregates booking data into a daily report per planet.

1. Open `include/sql/report.sql` and review the query. Notice that it expects a `$reportDate` parameter and uses an upsert pattern (`ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE`) to handle re-runs gracefully.
2. The query is missing the `total_paid_usd` column. Find the **two** `-- TODO` comments in the SQL file and add the missing aggregations following the pattern of the other columns.

> [!NOTE]
> Open `include/sql/schema.sql` to see the available tables with their schemas.

3. Create a `SQLExecuteQueryOperator` with task_id `generate_report` that:
    - Uses the `report.sql` file
    - Passes the **logical date** formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD` as a parameter named `reportDate`

    Unlike the previous task which used `params` for Jinja templating, **this task needs to use `parameters` to pass values directly to the database driver** (for DuckDB's `$variable` syntax).

> [!TIP]
> You need to find the right Airflow template variable for the formatted logical date. See the [templates reference](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/templates-ref.html).

4. Ensure you assign the operator to a variable called `_generate_report`.

## Add data validation

Before we publish the report, we have to validate that the data meets quality expectations.

1. Add a `SQLColumnCheckOperator` task:

    ```python
    _validate_report = SQLColumnCheckOperator(
        task_id="validate_report",
        conn_id=_DUCKDB_CONN_ID,
        table="daily_planet_report",
        column_mapping={
            "planet_name": {
                "null_check":     {"equal_to": 0},
                "distinct_check": {"geq_to": 3},
            },
            "total_passengers": {
                "null_check":     {"equal_to": 0},
                "min":            {"geq_to": 1},
            }
        },
        outlets=Asset("daily_report")
    )
    ```

    The `outlets` parameter declares that this task produces the `daily_report` asset. Downstream Dags can subscribe to this asset to trigger automatically when new data is available.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about [data quality checks](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/airflow-sql-data-quality) and [assets](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/airflow-datasets).

## Wire up the tasks

Use `chain()` to define the execution order.

1. At the end of the `daily_report()` function, add:

    ```python
    chain(
        _ingest_data,
        _generate_report,
        _validate_report
    )
    ```

## Test your Dag

1. In the Astro IDE, click _Sync to Test_ to deploy your changes.
2. Open the Airflow UI and trigger the `daily_report` Dag.
3. Verify all tasks complete successfully.
4. Check the _Assets_ view in Airflow (from the navigation on the left) and open the `daily_report` asset, to confirm the asset update shows under _Asset Events_.

> [!TIP]
> **Sync tips:**
> - ⚡ Changes to Dag files sync faster. Changes to files in `include/` trigger an image rebuild, which takes longer.
> - 🤖 While waiting for a sync, you can ask the Astro IDE AI questions about your Dag or about Airflow in general.
> - 💾 You don't need to commit your changes. If you want to keep your code after the workshop, fork the repository first.

## (Optional) See data validation in action

To understand how data quality checks protect your pipeline, let's intentionally trigger a failure. This is optional, as it requires multiple Dag syncs and therefore takes more time.

1. In your `_validate_report` task, change the `distinct_check` threshold from `3` to `42`:

    ```python
    "distinct_check": {"geq_to": 42},
    ```

2. Sync and trigger the Dag again.
3. Observe that the `validate_report` task fails. Open the task logs to see the validation error message.
4. Notice that the `daily_report` asset was **not** updated this time, the quality gate prevented bad data from being published.
5. Change the threshold back to `3`, sync, and run the Dag once more to confirm it passes.

## (Optional) See the data in the dashboard

Time for some fun with data visualization. Now that our daily report Dag is running, let's look at an example of how it could be used in a real business context.

1. Run the `sync` Dag.
2. Open the _AstroTrips Dashboard_ in Airflow from the navigation bar on the left.

# Challenge: Mission control

It is time for a challenge.

The workshop provides a custom `MissionControlOperator`, which generates an interstellar clearance code based on your implementation. Only if you finished all tasks successfully until here, including using the correct task IDs and dependencies, the code will be correct.

1. Add the following import to your `daily_report.py` implementation:

    ```py
    from include.mission_control import MissionControlOperator
    ```

2. Create an instance of the operator within your `@dag` function, and assign the task ID `mission_control`:

    ```py
    _mission_control = MissionControlOperator(task_id="mission_control")
    ```

3. Add the task as a last step in your Dag:

    ```py
    chain(
        _ingest_data,
        _generate_report,
        _validate_report,
        _mission_control
    )
    ```

4. Sync your changes, trigger your `daily_report` Dag, and check the task logs so see the clearance code.
5. Share the code with the workshop host. In an online even, use the Zoom Q&A feature. In an in-person even, raise your hand so the host can verify your solution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The first 3 that finish this challenge successfully receive a gift from Astronomer!


## (Optional - feature highlight) Dag versioning

One of the main features introduced with Airflow 3 is Dag Versioning. By adding the `MissionControlOperator`, we changed the structure of the Dag, and running the Dag with the new structure created a new Dag version. Let's see how it works:

1. Open the Dags view from the main navigation.
2. Open your `daily_report` Dag.
3. Switch to the Dag graph view, by clicking the icon on the top left.
4. Click on _Options_ and compare the graph of the different Dag versions.

    ![Dag versioning in graph view](doc/screenshot-dag-versioning.png)

If you open the _Code_ tab in the Dag view, you can compare different versions of your implementation.

> [!NOTE]
> 💡 Why do you have multiple versions? Each time you modified the Dag structure (adding the HITL operator), Airflow created a new version to track these changes. But only, if a Dag run is between the changes.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about [Dag versioning and what Dag bundles are](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/airflow-dag-versioning).

## (Optional - feature highlight) backfill via Airflow UI

Another new feature of the new Airflow 3 UI is the integrated backfill functionality. Let's reload some days of the daily report:

1. Open the Dags view from the main navigation.
2. Open your `daily_report` Dag.
3. Click on _Trigger_ on the top right.
4. Under _Date Range_ select a range that includes 2 Dag runs.
5. Select _All Runs_ as _Reprocess Behavior_. This will reload the Dag runs no matter if they already ran successful, with an error, or not exist at all.
6. Ensure to set _Max Active Runs_ to 1, so we load each day one by one.

    ![Trigger a backfill](doc/screenshot-backfill-1.png)

7. Click on _Run Backfill_ and watch the magic happen.

> [!NOTE]
> Take note of the backfill indicator on top of the page. It will automatically disappear once the reload is done.

![Backfill indicator](doc/screenshot-backfill-2.png)

8. Now that we used the backfill feature to reload historical data, let's visualize it using the dashboard plugin! Run the `sync` Dag to sync the data.
9. Open the _AstroTrips Dashboard_ in Airflow from the navigation bar on the left.

# Exercise 2: Asset-aware scheduling for data-driven Dag dependencies

In this exercise, you will create a second Dag that is triggered automatically when the `daily_report` asset is updated. Since the `SQLColumnCheckOperator` updates the `daily_report` asset, it means every time data has been checked, the asset is updated and the second Dag will be triggered. This pattern decouples data producers from consumers.

**What you will learn:**

- Using assets for data-driven Dag dependencies.
- Pulling data from upstream tasks via XCom.

## Create the Dag file

1. In the Astro IDE, create a new file `dags/publish_report.py`.
2. Add the following imports:

    ```python
    from airflow.providers.common.sql.operators.sql import SQLExecuteQueryOperator
    from airflow.sdk import dag, task, chain, Asset

    _DUCKDB_CONN_ID = "duckdb_astrotrips"
    ```

3. Define the Dag with asset-aware scheduling:

    ```python
    @dag(
        schedule=Asset("daily_report"),
        tags=["astrotrips", "reporting"]
    )
    def publish_report():
        pass

    publish_report()
    ```

    By passing an `Asset` to the `schedule` parameter, this Dag will trigger whenever the `daily_report` Asset is updated by the upstream Dag.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about [Asset-aware scheduling](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/airflow-datasets).

## Add the query task

Fetch the latest report data from the database.

1. Inside the `publish_report()` function, add:

    ```python
    _get_report = SQLExecuteQueryOperator(
        task_id="get_report",
        conn_id=_DUCKDB_CONN_ID,
        sql="SELECT * FROM daily_planet_report WHERE report_date = (SELECT MAX(report_date) FROM daily_planet_report)"
    )
    ```

    Since this Dag is triggered by an asset, there is no logical date. Which means, we can't use `{{ ds }}`. Instead, the query fetches the most recent report.

## Add a Python task

Create a task that formats and prints the report. In a real scenario, this could send an email, update a dashboard, or call an external API.

1. Add the following `@task`-decorated function inside the Dag:

    ```python
    @task
    def print_report(ti=None):
        from include.utils import print_report_row

        rows = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids="get_report") or []

        print("::group::Daily Planet Report")
        print("Planet | Passengers | Active | Done | Gross USD | Discount | Net USD")
        print("-" * 65)

        for row in rows:
            print_report_row(row)

        print("::endgroup::")
    ```

    The `ti.xcom_pull()` method retrieves the query results from the upstream task. XCom (cross-communication) is Airflow's mechanism for passing data between tasks.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about [passing data between tasks](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/airflow-passing-data-between-tasks).

## Wire up the tasks

1. At the end of the `publish_report()` function, add:

    ```python
    chain(
        _get_report,
        print_report()
    )
    ```

## Test the Asset-triggered Dag

1. Sync your changes to the test deployment.
2. In the Airflow UI, navigate to the _Dags_ view.
3. Trigger the `daily_report` Dag from Exercise 1.
4. Once the quality check in `daily_report` completes, observe that `publish_report` is triggered automatically.
5. Open the `publish_report` Dag run and check the logs of the `print_report` task to see the formatted output.

# Exercise 3: ELT and dynamic task mapping

In this exercise, you will build an ingest pipeline that fetches weather data from an external API for all planets. You'll use **dynamic task mapping** to parallelize the API calls at runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> This is an Extract-Load (EL) pipeline, not full ELT. We extract from the API and load into the database. A true ELT would add a transform step *after* loading to create derived tables.

**What you will learn:**

- Writing a Python `@task` to load data from an API.
- Using `.expand()` to dynamically create tasks at runtime.
- Collecting results from mapped tasks for downstream processing.

## Create the Dag file

1. Create `dags/weather_ingest.py` with the following structure:

    ```python
    from airflow.providers.common.sql.operators.sql import SQLExecuteQueryOperator, SQLInsertRowsOperator
    from airflow.sdk import chain, dag, task

    _DUCKDB_CONN_ID = "duckdb_astrotrips"


    @dag(
        schedule="@daily",
        tags=["astrotrips", "ingest"],
    )
    def weather_ingest():
        pass


    weather_ingest()
    ```

## Add the extract tasks

1. Add a `SQLExecuteQueryOperator` to get all planet IDs, then a task to extract them:

    ```python
    _get_planets = SQLExecuteQueryOperator(
        task_id="get_planets",
        conn_id=_DUCKDB_CONN_ID,
        sql="SELECT DISTINCT planet_id FROM planets",
    )

    @task
    def extract_planet_ids(query_result):
        """Extract planet IDs from query result rows."""
        return [row[0] for row in query_result]
    ```

2. Add a task to fetch weather for a single planet from the API. This task will be dynamically mapped later to run multiple times in parallel:

    ```python
    @task
    def fetch_weather(planet_id: int, logical_date=None):
        from include.weather_api import get_planet_weather
        return get_planet_weather(planet_id, logical_date.date())
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> The `logical_date` parameter is automatically injected by Airflow.

## Add the load task

We will use a `SQLInsertRowsOperator` to insert the rows into a `planet_weather` table. However, this operator expects tuples.

1. Add the following task to prepare the weather data for the insert operation:

```python
@task
def prepare_rows(weather_data: list[dict]):
    """Transform weather dicts to tuples for SQLInsertRowsOperator."""
    return [
        (w["planet_id"], w["reading_date"], w["temperature_c"], w["storm_risk"], w["visibility"])
        for w in weather_data
    ]
```

2. Next, we wire up the tasks we have so far, so that we ca use the prepared rows as next step. Add the following dependency definition to your Dag:

```python
planet_ids = extract_planet_ids(_get_planets.output)
weather_data = fetch_weather.expand(planet_id=planet_ids)
rows = prepare_rows(weather_data)
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `.expand(planet_id=planet_ids)` creates one `fetch_weather` task instance per planet. When `prepare_rows` receives `weather_data`, Airflow automatically collects all outputs from the mapped tasks into a list.

3. Add the `SQLInsertRowsOperator` with a `preoperator` to make it idempotent:

```python
_insert_rows = SQLInsertRowsOperator(
    task_id="load_weather",
    conn_id=_DUCKDB_CONN_ID,
    table_name="planet_weather",
    columns=["planet_id", "reading_date", "temperature_c", "storm_risk", "visibility"],
    rows=rows,
    preoperator="DELETE FROM planet_weather WHERE reading_date = '{{ ds }}';",
)
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `preoperator` deletes existing records for the current date before inserting, ensuring idempotent re-runs. The `planet_weather` table must already exist (created by the `setup` Dag).

4. Ensure Airflow runs the insert after preparing the rows, by adding the following dependency definition:

```python
chain(rows, _insert_rows)
```

## Test your Dag

1. Sync and trigger the `weather_ingest` Dag.
2. In the Graph view, observe the `fetch_weather` task shows brackets `[ ]` indicating it's mapped.
3. Click on `fetch_weather` and inspect the task instances, to see the runtime generated, parallel tasks (_one per planet_).
4. Click on `load_weather` and inspect the logs to verify the number of rows, which have been loaded to the table.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about [dynamic task mapping](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/dynamic-tasks).

# Exercise 4: Human-in-the-loop

In this exercise, you will build a Dag that pauses for human input using a human-in-the-loop operator. The workflow lets an operator update a planet-to-planet route's base fare.

**What you will learn:**

- Using `HITLEntryOperator` to collect user input mid-workflow.
- Passing HITL output to downstream tasks.

## Create the Dag file

1. Create `dags/update_fare.py` with the following structure:

    ```python
    from airflow.providers.common.sql.operators.sql import SQLExecuteQueryOperator
    from airflow.providers.standard.operators.hitl import HITLEntryOperator
    from airflow.sdk import dag, task, chain, Param

    _DUCKDB_CONN_ID = "duckdb_astrotrips"


    @dag(tags=["astrotrips", "hitl"])
    def update_fare():
        pass


    update_fare()
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> This Dag is meant to run manually, so it has no `schedule`. Since Airflow 3, the default value for `schedule` is `None`, so we do not need to set it explicitly.

## Add an operator to fetch current fares

1. Add a `SQLExecuteQueryOperator` to fetch the current route fares:

```python
_get_fares = SQLExecuteQueryOperator(
    task_id="get_current_fares",
    conn_id=_DUCKDB_CONN_ID,
    sql="""
        SELECT r.route_id, p.planet_name, r.base_fare_usd
        FROM routes r
        JOIN planets p ON p.planet_id = r.destination_id
        ORDER BY r.route_id
    """,
)
```

2. Add a task to format the results for display in the HITL body and store the result in a variable, using the output of the previous task:

```python
@task
def format_fares(rows):
    """Format fare rows for display in HITL body."""
    return "\n".join([f"Route {r[0]}: {r[1]} - ${r[2]}" for r in rows])

_formatted_fares = format_fares(_get_fares.output)
```

## Add the HITL input task

The `HITLEntryOperator` pauses the Dag and waits for human input via the Airflow UI.

1. Add the following task to the Dag:

```python
_hitl_input = HITLEntryOperator(
    task_id="input_new_fare",
    subject="Update route base fare",
    body="Current fares:\n\n{{ ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='format_fares') }}",
    params={
        "route_id": Param(1, type="integer", description="Route ID to update"),
        "new_fare": Param(1000, type="integer", description="New base fare in USD"),
    },
)
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `body` uses Jinja templating to display formatted fares. The `params` define form fields for user input.

## Add tasks to apply and display the update

1. First, add a task to extract the parameters from the HITL output and store the result in a variable:

```python
@task
def build_update_params(hitl_output):
    """Extract params from HITL output for the UPDATE query."""
    return {
        "new_fare": hitl_output["params_input"]["new_fare"],
        "route_id": hitl_output["params_input"]["route_id"],
    }

_update_params = build_update_params(_hitl_input.output)
```

2. Then add a `SQLExecuteQueryOperator` for the `UPDATE` query, passing the params via `parameters`:

```python
_apply_update = SQLExecuteQueryOperator(
    task_id="apply_fare_update",
    conn_id=_DUCKDB_CONN_ID,
    sql="UPDATE routes SET base_fare_usd = $new_fare WHERE route_id = $route_id",
    parameters=_update_params,
)
```

3. Add another task to fetch the updated fares:

```python
_get_updated_fares = SQLExecuteQueryOperator(
    task_id="get_updated_fares",
    conn_id=_DUCKDB_CONN_ID,
    sql="""
        SELECT r.route_id, p.planet_name, r.base_fare_usd
        FROM routes r
        JOIN planets p ON p.planet_id = r.destination_id
        ORDER BY r.route_id
    """,
)
```

4. Add a task to display the results:

```python
@task
def print_updated_fares(rows):
    """Print the updated fares to logs."""
    print("::group::Updated Route Fares")
    print("Route ID | Destination | Base Fare")
    print("-" * 40)
    for row in rows:
        print(f"{row[0]:8} | {row[1]:11} | ${row[2]}")
    print("::endgroup::")
```

## Wire up the tasks

1. Finally, wire up all tasks by defining the dependencies:

```python
chain(
    _formatted_fares,
    _hitl_input,
    _update_params,
    _apply_update,
    _get_updated_fares,
    print_updated_fares(_get_updated_fares.output)
)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note how `_hitl_input.output` passes the HITL response to `build_update_params`, and `.output` is used to pass query results to tasks. This is how to combine the TaskFlow API approach of passing data between tasks with classic operators.

## Test the HITL workflow

1. Sync and trigger the `update_fare` Dag.
2. The Dag pauses at `input_new_fare`. Click on the task and open the **Required Actions** tab.

    ![Required Actions tab](doc/screenshot-hitl-required-actions.png)

3. Enter a route ID (e.g., `1001`) and new fare, then click **Submit**.
4. The Dag continues. Check the `print_updated_fares` task logs to see the updated fares.
